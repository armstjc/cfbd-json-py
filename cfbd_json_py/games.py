    Retrives game schedule data from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB game information from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB game information.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB game information for non-regular season games, 
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason", 
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt 
        to load CFB game data from games in that season, and in that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB game information for a team, 
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB game information from.

    `home_team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want game information for a team, 
        where that team was the home team in this season,
        set `home_team` to the name of the team you want game information for.

    `away_team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want game information for a team, 
        where that team was the away team in this season,
        set `away_team` to the name of the team you want game information for.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want game information from games 
        involving teams a specific confrence, 
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation 
        of the conference you want game information from.

    `ncaa_division` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By default, `ncaa_division` will be set to "fbs", 
        short for the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), 
        formerly known as D1-A (read as "division one single A"),
        the highest level in the NCAA football pyramid,
        where teams can scolarship up to 85 players 
        on their football team soley for athletic ability, 
        and often have the largest athletics budgets
        within the NCAA.

        Other valid inputs are:
        - "fcs": Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), 
            formerly known as D1-AA (read as "division one double A").
            An FCS school is still in the 1st division of the NCAA,
            making them elligable for the March Madness tournament,
            but may not have the resources to compete at the FBS level
            at this time. FCS schools are limited to 63 athletic scolarships
            for football.
        - "ii": NCAA Division II. Schools in this and D3 are not
            elligable for the March Madness tournament, 
            and are limited to 36 athletic scolarships for their football team.
        - "iii": NCAA Division III. The largest single division within the 
            NCAA football pyramid. 
            D3 schools have the distinction of being part of 
            the only NCAA division that cannot give out scolarships soley 
            for athletic ability.

    `game_id` (int, optional):
        Optional argument. 
        If `game_id` is set to a game ID, `get_cfb_betting_lines()` will try to get 
        game information just for that game ID.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Get a team, or multiple team's record (wins, losses, ties) for home games, away games, 
    confrence games, and the team's record for that season.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        Specifies the season you want CFB team records data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for 
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()` 
        will be raised.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Semi-ptional argument.
        If you only want CFB team records data for a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB drive data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for 
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()` 
        will be raised.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB team records data from games 
        involving teams from a specific confrence, 
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation 
        of the conference you want CFB team records data from.
        For a list of confrences, 
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB media information for non-regular season games, 
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If you want both "regular" and "postseason" games retunred, 
        set `season_type` to "both"
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason", 
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt 
        to load CFB media information from games in that season, and in that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB media information for a team, 
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB media information from.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want media information from games 
        involving teams a specific confrence, 
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation 
        of the conference you want game information from.

    `media_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want game broadcast information for a specific type of broadcast,
        set this to the type of broadcast.

        Valid inputs are: 
        - `all` (default): Returns all games, and all known broadcasters for those games.
        - `tv`: Returns all known TV broadcasters for CFB games in the requested timeframe.
        - `radio`: Returns all known radio broadcasters 
            for CFB games in the requested timeframe.
        - `web`: Returns all known web broadcasts (like ESPN+) 
            for CFB games in the requested timeframe.
        - `ppv`: Returns all known Pay Per View (PPV) broadcasts 
            for CFB games in the requested timeframe.
        - `mobile`: Returns all known broadcasters that only broadcasted 
            games on mobile devices (?)

    `ncaa_division` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By default, `ncaa_division` will be set to "fbs", 
        short for the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), 
        formerly known as D1-A (read as "division one single A"),
        the highest level in the NCAA football pyramid,
        where teams can scolarship up to 85 players 
        on their football team soley for athletic ability, 
        and often have the largest athletics budgets
        within the NCAA.

        Other valid inputs are:
        - "fcs": Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), 
            formerly known as D1-AA (read as "division one double A").
            An FCS school is still in the 1st division of the NCAA,
            making them elligable for the March Madness tournament,
            but may not have the resources to compete at the FBS level
            at this time. FCS schools are limited to 63 athletic scolarships
            for football.
        - "ii": NCAA Division II. Schools in this and D3 are not
            elligable for the March Madness tournament, 
            and are limited to 36 athletic scolarships for their football team.
        - "iii": NCAA Division III. The largest single division within the 
            NCAA football pyramid. 
            D3 schools have the distinction of being part of 
            the only NCAA division that cannot give out scolarships soley 
            for athletic ability.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB media information from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB media information.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB media information for non-regular season games, 
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason", 
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    **For the following three variables, 
    at least one must be set to a non-null variable when calling this function.**

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt 
        to load CFB media information from games in that season, and in that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB media information for a team, 
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB media information from.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want media information from games 
        involving teams a specific confrence, 
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation 
        of the conference you want game information from.

    `stat_category` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If only want stats for a specific stat category, 
        set this variable to that category.

        Valid inputs are:
        - `passing`
        - `rushing`
        - `receiving`
        - `fumbles`
        - `defensive`
        - `interceptions`
        - `punting`
        - `kicking`
        - `kickReturns`
        - `puntReturns`

    `game_id` (int, optional):
        Optional argument. 
        If `game_id` is set to a game ID, `get_cfbd_player_game_stats()` will try to get 
        player game stats just for that game ID.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.
    
    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
