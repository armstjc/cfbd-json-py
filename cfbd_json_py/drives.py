    Retrives a list of CFB drives from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB drive information from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB drive information.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB drive data for non-regular season games,
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason",
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt
        to load CFB drive data from games in that season, and that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data for a team,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB drive data from.

    `offensive_team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data from a team, while they are on offense,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB drive data from.

    `defensive_team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data from a team, while they are on defense,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want CFB drive data from.

    `conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data from games
        involving teams from a specific confrence,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want CFB drive data from.
        For a list of confrences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `offensive_conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data from games
        where the offensive team is from a specific confrenece,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want CFB drive data from.
        For a list of confrences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `defensive_conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB drive data from games
        where the defensive team is from a specific confrenece,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want CFB drive data from.
        For a list of confrences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `ncaa_division` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By default, `ncaa_division` will be set to "fbs",
        short for the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS),
        formerly known as D1-A (read as "division one single A"),
        the highest level in the NCAA football pyramid,
        where teams can scolarship up to 85 players
        on their football team soley for athletic ability,
        and often have the largest athletics budgets
        within the NCAA.

        Other valid inputs are:
        - "fcs": Football Championship Subdivision (FCS),
            formerly known as D1-AA (read as "division one double A").
            An FCS school is still in the 1st division of the NCAA,
            making them elligable for the March Madness tournament,
            but may not have the resources to compete at the FBS level
            at this time. FCS schools are limited to 63 athletic scolarships
            for football.
        - "ii": NCAA Division II. Schools in this and D3 are not
            elligable for the March Madness tournament,
            and are limited to 36 athletic scolarships for their football team.
        - "iii": NCAA Division III. The largest single division within the
            NCAA football pyramid.
            D3 schools have the distinction of being part of
            the only NCAA division that cannot give out scolarships soley
            for athletic ability.

    `offense` (str):
        Alternative keyword for `offensive_team`

    `defense` (str):
        Alternative keyword for `defensive_team`

    `classification` (str):
        Alternative keyword for `ncaa_division`

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
