    """
    Given a down and distance,
    this function will attempt to get the predicted
    PPA value for that down and distance,
    at every yard line possible for that down and distance.

    PPA is the CFBD API's equivalent metric to Expected Points Added (EPA).

    For this endpoint,
    [`yardLine`] is the number of yards from 1 (offense has the ball on their side,
    at their 1 yard line), to 99
    (offense with the ball with a X and goal situation on the opponent's 1 yard line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `down` (int, mandatory):
        Mandatory argument.
        This is the down (a number between 1 and 4 in normal situations)
        for this play you want PPA for.

    `distance` (int, mandatory):
        Mandatory argument.
        This variable should be set to the number of yards between
        the line of scrimage (LOS), and the first down line on the field.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        Specifies the season you want team PPA data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Semi-ptional argument.
        If you only want team PPA data for a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want team PPA data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team PPA data from games
        involving teams from a specific confrence,
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want team PPA data from.
        For a list of confrences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Allows you to get team PPA data,
    at a game level,
    with or without garbage time plays,
    for a specificed team and/or time period.

    PPA is the CFBD API's equivalent metric to Expected Points Added (EPA).

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want team game PPA data information from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get team game PPA data information.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt
        to load team game PPA data from games in that season, and in that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team game PPA data for a team,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want team game PPA data from.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team game PPA data from games
        involving teams a specific confrence,
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want team game PPA data from.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want team game PPA data for non-regular season games,
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason",
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

        `week` and/or `team` must be set to a non-null value for this function
        to work.

    `team` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want player game PPA data for players of a specific team,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want player game PPA data from.
        `week` and/or `team` must be set to a non-null value for this function
        to work.

    `position` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player game PPA data for players of a specific position,
        set `position` to the position you want player game PPA data from.

    `player_id` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want PPA data for a specific player ID,
        set this variable to the player ID of the player you want PPA data from.

    `play_threshold`
        Optional argument.
        If you only want PPA data for players
        who touched the ball for *X* number of plays in a game,
        set `play_threshold = x`, where `x` is
        your specified minimum number of plays.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want player game PPA data for non-regular season games,
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason",
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Allows you to get player PPA data,
    at a season level,
    with or without garbage time plays,
    for a specificed time period and/or team.

    PPA is the CFBD API's equivalent metric to Expected Points Added (EPA).

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, semi-optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        Specifies the season you want player season PPA data information from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get player season PPA data information.


    `team` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want player season PPA data for players of a specific team,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want player season PPA data from.
        `week` and/or `team` must be set to a non-null value for this function
        to work.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player season PPA data from games
        involving teams from a specific confrence,
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want player season PPA data from.
        For a list of confrences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `position` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player season PPA data for players of a specific position,
        set `position` to the position you want player season PPA data from.

    `player_id` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want PPA data for a specific player ID,
        set this variable to the player ID of the player you want PPA data from.

    `play_threshold`
        Optional argument.
        If you only want PPA data for players
        who touched the ball for *X* number of plays in a game,
        set `play_threshold = x`, where `x` is
        your specified minimum number of plays.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.


    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Allows one to get win probabliity data for a given game ID.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `game_id` (int, mandatory):
        Mandatory argument.
        This is the game ID for the game you want win probability data from,
        at the play-by-play level.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Allows you to get pregame win probability data for games within a timeframe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        Specifies the season you want pregame win probability data.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt
        to load CFB game data from games in that season, and in that week.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Semi-ptional argument.
        If you only want pregame win probability data for a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want pregame win probability data from.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB game information for non-regular season games,
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason",
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
