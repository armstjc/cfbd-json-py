    Retrives a list of NFL teams from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Usage

    Retrives a list of actual NFL Draft selections from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    The following paramaters are optional, but it is highly reccomended to not call this function
    withiout settting one of these five optional paramaters to a non-null value.

    `season` (int, semi-optional):
        Semi-Optional argument. 
        This is the season you want NFL Draft information for. For example, if you only want 
        data for the 2020 NFL Draft, set `season` to `2020`.

    `nfl_team` (str, optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want NFL Draft selections from a specific NFL team, set `nfl_team` to the 
        name of that team. For example, if you want to only get NFL Draft information for 
        draft picks made by the Cincinnati Bengals, set `nfl_team` to `Cincinnati`.

    `college` (str, optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want NFL Draft selections from a specific CFB team, set `college` to the 
        name of that team. For example, if you want to only get NFL Draft information for 
        draft picks from the Clemson Tigers Football Program, set `college` to `Clemson`.

    `conference` (str, optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want NFL Draft selections from a specific CFB confrence, set `conference` to the abbreviation of that confrence. 
        A list of CFBD API confrence abbreviations can be found in the `conference_abbreviation` column from 
        the pandas DataFrame that is returned by calling `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`.
        For example, if you want to only get NFL Draft information for 
        draft picks that played in the Big 12, set `confrence` to `B12`.

    `position` (str, optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want NFL Draft selections who played a specific position, 
        set `position` to that position's abbreviation. 
        A list of CFBD API positions can be found in the `position_abbreviation` column from 
        the pandas DataFrame that is returned by calling `cfbd_json_py.draft.get_cfbd_nfl_positions()`.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
