    Given a string, search for players who's
    name matches that string in some capacity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `search_str` (int, mandatory):
        Mandatory argument.
        This is the name of the player you are trying to find.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null,
        this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find
        a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `position` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want players from a specific position,
        set `position` to the position you want to find players from.

    `team` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want players from a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want to find players from.

    `season` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want players from a specific CFB season,
        set `season` to the season you want to find players from.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return
        the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Get player usage data

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, optional):
        Mandatory argument.
        Specifies the season you want player usage data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null,
        this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find
        a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want player usage data for a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want player usage data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `position` (str, optional):
        Semi-Optional argument.
        If you only want player usage data
        for players who played a specific position,
        set `position` to that position's abbreviation.
        A list of CFBD API positions can be found
        in the `position_abbreviation` column from
        the pandas DataFrame that is returned
        by calling `cfbd_json_py.draft.get_cfbd_nfl_positions()`.

    `conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player usage data from games
        involving teams from a specific conference,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want player usage data from.
        For a list of conferences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `player_id` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player usage data for a specific player ID,
        set this variable to the player ID
        of the player you want player usage data from.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays
        where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return
        the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Get data from the CFBD API

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null,
        this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find
        a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        Specifies the season you want team PPA data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you only want team PPA data for a specific team,
        set `team` to the name of the team you want team PPA data from.
        You MUST set `season` or `team` to a non-null value for
        this function to work. If you don't, a `ValueError()`
        will be raised.

    `conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team PPA data from games
        involving teams from a specific conference,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want team PPA data from.
        For a list of conferences,
        use the `cfbd_json_py.conferences.get_cfbd_conference_info()`
        function.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return
        the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    """
    Get player season stats,
    or the stats of players in a specific time frame, from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB player season stats from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept
        the request to get CFB player season stats.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null,
        this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find
        a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want CFB player season stats for a team,
        regardless if they are the home/away team,
        set `team` to the name of the team
        you want CFB player season stats from.

    `conference` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player season stats from games
        involving teams a specific conference,
        set `conference` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want stats from.

    `start_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    `end_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want player stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    **NOTE**: If the following conditions are `True`, a `ValueError()`
    will be raised when calling this function:
    - `start_week < 0`
    - `end_week < 0`
    - `start_week is not None and end_week is None`
        (will be changed in a future version)
    - `start_week is None and end_week is not None`
        (will be changed in a future version)
    - `end_week < start_week`
    - `end_week = start_week`

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By default, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB media information for non-regular season games,
        set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If you want ***both*** regular
        and postseason stats, set `season_type = "both"`.
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular",
        "postseason",  or "both", a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `stat_category` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If only want stats for a specific stat category,
        set this variable to that category.

        Valid inputs are:
        - `passing`
        - `rushing`
        - `receiving`
        - `fumbles`
        - `defensive`
        - `interceptions`
        - `punting`
        - `kicking`
        - `kickReturns`
        - `puntReturns`

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return
        the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

):
    """
    Get player usage data
    (A.K.A., the percentages for how often a player touched the ball),
    for a given season, from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `season` (int, mandatory):
        Required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB transfer portal data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept
        the request to get CFB transfer portal data stats.

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null,
        this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find
        a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return
        the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
