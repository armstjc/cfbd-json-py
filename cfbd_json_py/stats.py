    Allows you to get CFB team season stats data from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB team season stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `team` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `team` (str, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB team season stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `season` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `conference_abv` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team season stats from games
        involving teams a specific confrence,
        set `conference_abv` to the abbreviation
        of the conference you want stats from.

    `start_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    `end_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    **NOTE**: If the following conditions are `True`, a `ValueError()`
    will be raised when calling this function:
    - `start_week < 0`
    - `end_week < 0`
    - `start_week != None and end_week == None` (will be changed in a future version)
    - `start_week == None and end_week != None` (will be changed in a future version)
    - `end_week < start_week`
    - `end_week = start_week`

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    """
    Allows you to get advanced CFB team season stats data from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB team season stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `team` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `team` (str, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want advanced CFB team season stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `season` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `start_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    `end_week` (int, semi-optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want team stats for a range of weeks,
        set `start_week` and `end_week` to
        the range of weeks you want season-level data for.

    **NOTE**: If the following conditions are `True`, a `ValueError()`
    will be raised when calling this function:
    - `start_week < 0`
    - `end_week < 0`
    - `start_week != None and end_week == None` (will be changed in a future version)
    - `start_week == None and end_week != None` (will be changed in a future version)
    - `end_week < start_week`
    - `end_week = start_week`

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    """
    Allows you to get advanced CFB team game stats data from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory,
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `season` (int, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want CFB team game stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `team` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `team` (str, semi-mandatory):
        Semi-required argument.
        Specifies the season you want advanced CFB team game stats data from.
        This must be specified, otherwise this package, and by extension
        the CFBD API, will not accept the request to get CFB team season stats data.
        This or `season` must be set to a valid non-null variable for this to function.

    `week` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `week` is set to an integer, this function will attempt 
        to load CFB team game from games in that season, and that week.

    `opponent` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want games from a specific opponent, 
        set `opponent` to the name of that team.


    `exclude_garbage_time` (bool, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter out plays where the result of the game is largely decided,
        set `exclude_garbage_time = True`.
        Default behavior is that this variable is set to
        `False` when this function is called.

    `season_type` (str, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        By defualt, this will be set to "regular", for the CFB regular season.
        If you want CFB team game stats, set `season_type` to "postseason".
        If `season_type` is set to anything but "regular" or "postseason", 
        a `ValueError()` will be raised.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object),
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.

    Returns a list of stat categories for team stats directly from the CFBD API.

    Parameters
    ----------

    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to am empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
