    Retrives information from the CFBD API on CFB Head Coaches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `api_key` (str, optional):
        Semi-optional argument. 
        If `api_key` is null, this function will attempt to load a CFBD API key
        from the python environment, or from a file on this computer.
        If `api_key` is not null, this function will automatically assume that the
        inputted `api_key` is a valid CFBD API key.

    `api_key_dir` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If `api_key` is set to a string non-empty string, this variable is ignored.
        If `api_key_dir` is null, and `api_key` is null, 
        this function will try to find a CFBD API key file in this user's home directory.
        If `api_key_dir` is set to a string, and `api_key` is null,
        this function will assume that `api_key_dir` is a directory, 
        and will try to find a CFBD API key file in that directory.

    `first_name` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to only look up coaches with a specific first name, 
        set this variable to that specific first name, and this function 
        will attempt to look up coaches with that specific first name.

    `last_name` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to only look up coaches with a specific last name, 
        set this variable to that specific first name, and this function 
        will attempt to look up coaches with that specific last name.

    `team` (str, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you want to filter and drill down to coaches who coached a specific
        CFB team, set this 

    `season` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        If you only want coaches from a specific season, set this variable to that season.

    `min_season` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        Similar to `year`, but used in tandem with `max_season` to get coaches who coached with in a range of seasons.

    `max_season` (int, optional):
        Optional argument.
        Similar to `year`, but used in tandem with `min_season` to get coaches who coached with in a range of seasons.

    `return_as_dict` (bool, semi-optional):
        Semi-optional argument.
        If you want this function to return the data as a dictionary (read: JSON object), 
        instead of a pandas `DataFrame` object,
        set `return_as_dict` to `True`.
